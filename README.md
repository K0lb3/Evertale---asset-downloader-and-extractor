# Evertale - asset downloader & extractor

**You're only allowed to use this script if you own the game**

A small project that downloads all assets as well as the data of Evertale and extracts them while it's at it.

The script updates the assets and even its own parameters required for downloading the assets on its own,
so all you have to do is execute the ``update_assets.py`` script after every update to get the latest files.

## Script Requirements

- Python 3.6+

- UnityPy 1.7.10
- requests

```cmd
pip install UnityPy==1.7.10
pip install requests
```
